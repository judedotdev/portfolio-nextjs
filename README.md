## PLP August Cohort Portfolio Challenge

This project was built as a submission for the PLP August Cohort Portfolio Challenge. The challenge aims to help participants create a comprehensive portfolio to showcase their skills and projects in software development, web design, and other relevant fields.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, making the website fast and SEO-friendly.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs directly in the markup, allowing for rapid styling without writing traditional CSS.

## To Run The Project on Your Laptop

First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/judedotdev/portfolio.git
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
